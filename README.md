First try to mod old good Unclaimed World game.

That one just add Editor and Test buttons in main menu to edit and run custom maps.

Need UnclaimedWorldInjector modloader to work: https://github.com/Kastuk/UnclaimedWorldInjector/releases/tag/untidy

Install: put dll into Steam\steamapps\common\Unclaimed World\Mods

Don't forget special editor keys, which written in Documents\Unclaimed World\Options.xml
