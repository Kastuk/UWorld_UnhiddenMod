First try to mod old good Unclaimed World game.

Features:
- add Editor and Test buttons in main menu to edit and run custom maps.
- add shadows disabling (key O for now)
- add mouse scroll feature to datasheet window (recipes of item)

Need UnclaimedWorldInjector modloader to work: https://github.com/Kastuk/UnclaimedWorldInjector/releases/tag/untidy

Install: put dll into **Steam\steamapps\common\Unclaimed World\Mods**

Don't forget special editor keys, which written in **Documents\Unclaimed World\Options.xml**

Don't have Options.xml be opened, when you save the game, it will crash.
